# Simpler Machine Learning

This is the JavaScript code for the Interactions on my [Simpler Machine Learning](https://www.simplermachinelearning.com) website. I see Interactions 
as the [The Future of Scientific Communication](https://www.simplermachinelearning.com/interactions.html).

The code above is experimental and not production. Thus, it incorporates some poor practices such as the repetition of the same code across different sections of 
the website.

    <p>For all of human history, mathematical and scientific communication has been carried out using static text and 
    diagrams. Sometime during this century, there will be a complete shift towards dynamic, interactive media. That is, 
    mathematical and scientific communication will be carried out primarily using text and diagrams dancing on the 
    computer screen, interacting all the time with the user. I call these dynamic interactive media “Interactions”. 
    One current way to enable them is using the HTML5 “canvas” element with JavaScript on the web page.</p>

  	<p>Some of the most initial, primitive, halting steps in this direction are on display on some of today’s websites, 
  	and indeed, on this one.  Much of science and engineering is enabled using differential equations, and in the future, 
  	along with the differential equations, there will be visual interactions with the differential equations, 
  	tailored to the application at hand. Likewise for all other types of related mathematics.</p>

    <p>The result will be nothing less than the democratization of science. Advanced researchers will be able to 
    communicate their ideas to any person with basic scientific literacy, rather than just their immediate peers. As 
  	an outcome of this, there will be a lot more cross-fertilization between different fields of science. The key 
  	to realizing this vision in its entirety is to come up with a set of general purpose APIs that can be used across 
  	a variety of applications. Along with these APIs, there should be a set of “design patterns” that guide the writers 
  	in creating the Interactions.</p>

    <p>You may argue, perhaps with some justification, that what I call an Interaction is nothing but a simulation. 
    That may well be true in some cases. But in general, the difference between Interactions and simulations is that 
    while the purpose of simulations is to display a visual solution to an equation, the purpose of Interactions is 
    to communicate the content of an equation in a broader way. The difference between Interactions and Mathematica is 
    that while Mathematica is a system for computation, Interactions are a system for communication which can include 
    computation.</p>

		<p>The Interactions presented on this website in the context of the machine learning pages have a light grey
		background. They are intended to be intuitive to use. For most of the Interactions, you just have to hover over the
		circles or connecting lines (neurons or weights), with your mouse, or press the appropriate buttons. A brief
		description of how to engage with each Interaction is given in the paragraph preceding it. I’ll mention that I still
		use ordinary static diagrams at places – they have a plain white background.</p>

		<p>The machine learning Interactions presented on this website are as follows:</p>

		<p><a href="../math.html#Interaction_Functions">Math: Functions</a><br>
		<a href="../intro.html#Interaction_Basics">Introducing Neural Networks: Basics</a><br>
		<a href="../xor.html#Interaction_Weights">XOR: Playing with the Weights</a><br>
		<a href="../xor.html#Interaction_Training">XOR: Playing with Training</a><br>
		<a href="../xor.html#Interaction_Backpropagation">XOR: Backpropagation in Detail</a></p>

		<p>All of these Interactions make use of the HTML5 "canvas" element and are coded in JavaScript.
    The <a href="https://github.com/myinteractions/sml/">code for the above Interactions</a> is hosted at 
    GitHub.</p>

    <p>An excellent and very simple example of how equations can be made interactive is at the 
    <a href="https://www.maxwells-equations.com/">Maxwell’s Equations</a> website. The author achieves the ingenious 
    effect of making every term in each equation, including the equals signs, a clickable hyperlink which leads to a 
    page that describes that term. It is a great site for understanding Maxwell’s equations, which encompass all of 
    electricity and magnetism.</p>

    <h2 id="self_describing_equations">Self Describing Equations in General</h2>

    <p>While the Interaction in the above website is specific to Maxwell's equations, the Interactions demonstrated
    in the physics equations below are perfectly general and can be applied to any mathematical expression or
    equation whatsoever. They use <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a>, the gold standard for mathematical
    publishing on the Internet, which is written in JavaScript. If you hover over each term in the equations below,
    you will see a popup briefly describing that term.</p>

    <h3>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h3>
    <p>
    \begin{align}
      \texttip{F}{Force} = \texttip{m}{Mass} \texttip{a}{Acceleration}
    \end{align}
    </p>

   <h3>Maxwell's Equations of Electricity and Magnetism</h3>

    <p>
    \begin{align}
      \texttip{\nabla \times}{Curl, the circulation around a loop} \texttip{\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{Magnetic field} -\, \texttip{\frac1c}{One divided by the speed of light}\, \texttip{\frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t}}{Partial derivative of electric field <br>with respect to time} &amp; = \texttip{\frac{4\pi}{c}}{4 times pi divided by<br>the speed of light}\texttip{\vec{\mathbf{j}}}{The electric current} \\

      \texttip{\nabla \cdot}{Divergence, the flux through<br> a closed surface} \texttip{\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{Electric field} &amp; = \texttip{4 \pi}{4 times pi} \texttip{\rho}{The charge inside the surface} \\

      \texttip{\nabla \times}{Curl, the circulation around a loop} \texttip{\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{Electric field}\, +\, \texttip{\frac1c}{One divided by the speed of light}\, \texttip{\frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t}}{Partial derivative of magnetic field <br>with respect to time} &amp; = \texttip{\vec{\mathbf{0}}}{The zero vector} \\

      \texttip{\nabla \cdot}{Divergence, the flux through<br> a closed surface} \texttip{\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{Magnetic field} &amp; = \texttip{0}{Zero (scalar)}
    \end{align}
    </p>

    <h3>Schrodinger's Equation of Quantum Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
     \begin{align}
     \texttip{i}{The imaginary unit which is<br>the square root of -1} \texttip{\hbar}{The Planck's constant} \texttip{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{The partial derivative of the wave function<br>(which is a function of position and time)<br>with respect to time} = \texttip{\hat H}{The Hamiltonian operator} \texttip{\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{The Hamiltonian operator is applied<br> to the wave function}
     \end{align}
    </p>

    <p>
    I will point out that this is already a remarkable result. If everyone publishing mathematical content everywhere used this
    system, their mathematics would be far more accessible to readers who don't understand the symbols off-hand. You cannot get
    such a result on paper or pdf files; only on web pages. This is why I say, in my first paragraph above, that in the future
    all mathematical and scientific communication will be via text and diagrams dancing on the computer screen. The popups in the equations above are brief; they can be far more elaborate.
